## Essential Questions

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

This is the first attempt at being technical in the class. The goal is to
figure out where the students are along several dimensions:

1. How well do they setup a project's environment?
2. How much do they remember about programming?
3. What other things do I not know about?

### Setup

- Graded discussion rubrics ready to hand back
- `./chatbot_output_python/landscape_game.py` printed out
- `ProblemSetSkeleton` zipped and loaded into Schoology
    - https://gitlab.com/eric.rizzi/problem-set-skeleton
    - Remove `.git`, `.pytest_cache`, `.coverage`, `coverage.xml`
- Skills assessment worksheet posted on Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qt4WpGlUJX_-c_pszl-Al2Y12nbc3wcpDWMTOKnE-hw
- `problem_set_comprehensions.pdf` loaded into special folder for students who finish
    - Make folder "individually assigned" for this students

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection

    - What was his test?
    - What did we learn?
    - What is machine learning?
        - Program, data, and feedback
- Setup skills assessment
    - Today going to see how far you can get programming stuff
    - No pressure at all
- What do we remember about Python?
    - primitives
    - variables
    - lists
- Walk through `landscape_game.py` to futher job memory
    - JavaScript and Python on similar

    - What is happening on lines x, y, z?
- IDE
    - Brief history of IDE

    - Do simple programs as a class
        - Get everyone running a simple "hello world" program
        - Take in numbers from user until they hit "q" and then sums then
    - Highlight what extensions are doing
- Download and setup `ProblemSetSkeleton`
    - Importance of being in workspace
        - Get bunch of advanced features
        - Note to instructor: Check that people have proper setup repeatedly over coming days
    - Ignore files you don't understand
        - e.g., `.ci-cd`
- Get started on Skills Assessment
    - Walk through worksheet
    - Break up into pairs based on skill level
    - Walk around prodding people to improve practices in various ways

## Homework

- Finish problems 0 and 1 of Skills Assessment (aka the first two problems)
