### Computing Machinery and Intelligence

By: Alan Turing (1950)

#### Reading Prompts:

1. How does Turing propose to measure intelligence?
2. Why does Turing use a test to determine intelligence, rather than some sort
   of definition?

#### 1. The Imitation Game

I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with
definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be
framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a
definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is
expressed in relatively unambiguous words.

The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
"imitation game." [It is played with three participants, a human interrogator, an human
answerer, and a machine answerer. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other
two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two
is the person and which is the machine....]

#### 6. Contrary Views on the Main Question

It will simplify matters for the reader if I explain first my own beliefs in the matter.
Consider first the more accurate form of the question. I believe that in about fifty years
time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 10^9, to
make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have
more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of
questioning. The original question, "Can machines think?" I believe to be too
meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century
the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be
able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted...
