## Essential Questions

- Where does consciousness lie?
- What signals do we use to determine intelligence?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students are introduced to the Turing Test (along with some
background information on Alan Turing). Students are given a short snippet of
the Turing Test article and a brief discussion is had. Finally, the Turing Test
is enacted with a real ChatBot to really drive the point home.

### Setup

- Ear plugs/muffs to dampen sound
- Readings printed out
    - `computing_machinery_short.docx`
    - `computing_machinery_long.docx`

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - What did we do yesterday?
    - How do you think you might use ChatBots in other classes if your were allowed
        - For good?
        - For bad?
- Who's heard of Alan Turing?
    - Why he's famous...
    - Why he died prematurely
- Read a snippet from Computing Machinery and Intelligence paper (`computing_machinery_short.docx`)
    - What is Turing trying to describe?
    - Why? -> intelligence is hard to pinpoint?
    - How could we do this today in class?
- Rules:
    - Volunteer to ask questions and volunteer to answer
    - Questioner stands with their back to the class with ear plugs/muffs on
    - Questioner asks a question
        - Answerer answers
        - Teacher types question into Claude.ai
    - After 1m, teacher reads both answers
        - "Thing A says: ..."
        - "Thing B says: ..."
    - Once questioner thinks they know who's who, makes a guess
    - Once makes a guess, explains _why_ they made decision
    - Disallow that "type" of question and try again
        - Will eventually have list of types of questions that are disallowed
            - e.g., Doesn't know the name of the teacher -> no local context q's
- Go over list of types of questions and try to describe why AI struggles with each

### Extensions (if have time)

- Talk about the performance of different ChatBots over time
    - ELIZA: https://web.njit.edu/~ronkowit/eliza.html

### Homework

- Read `computing_machinery_long.docx` and prepare to discuss
