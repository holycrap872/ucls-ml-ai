## Essential Questions

- How do we get feedback about our code?
- How do we assess other people's code?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to expose students to the power of using ChatBots to
help them produce answers to their questions. First, we will do a code review
with a volunteers code. After this, I will explain how future code reviews will
go. Finally, we will do the same problem that we just did via ChatGPT and examine
the output. I will encourage students to use ChatGPT for the whole day to get
used to it. While they're working, I wil go around and suggest various things
(e.g., types and tests) that will help each of them as they encounter a problem.

### Setup

- Email to parents asking them if students can use Claude.ai / ChatGPT
- `colleges_ai.docx` printed out
    - https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/another-year-ai-college-cheating/679502/

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Why is being in a workspace important?
    - What should you do when you can't run tests?
- Code review
    - Ask for volunteer
    - Palindrome problem
        - Very common "break loop" structures
    - Max problem from earlier
        - Making stuff functions makes them easier to test
    - Discuss why they are good
    - "I would rather lose all my code than all my tests"
- Talk about "code review" expectations:
    - Rather than volunteer, wheel to see who get's picked on

    - If someone spots a bug in your code (hacker) they steal 5 points
        - Hacking is someone understanding your code better than you
- Put palindrome question into ChatGPT
    - Ask for unit tests
    - Critique the code
- Continue working on `Skills Assessment`
    - Now allowed to use ChatGPT
- Wrap up
    - Tomorrow discussion on ChatBot policy for this class
    - EQs:
        - What are appropriate ChatBot usages in other classes?
        - How could a ChatBot help/hurt learning?
        - How much control should each student have in their learning?
    - Be prepared

#### Homework

- Read `colleges_ai.docx`
