## EQ's

- Why are tests important?
- What is the best kind of test?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to give students enough information that they can
continue to independently work through the skills assessment. Prior to them
going off on their own, we will do a quick review. After that, I will introduce
unit tests and explain why they're so important. Finally, as a class we will
solve a simple problem - complete with unit tests - before the students finally
strike out on their own.

### Setup

- None

    - Create function that checks if word starts/ends with same letter
    - Function returns a boolean
    - Create three unit tests
