## EQ's

- What do we want to remember?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to give students enough information so that they can
continue to independently work through the skills assessment. Prior to them
going off on their own, we will do a quick review. Then, as a class we will
solve a simple problem before the students finally strike out on their own.
