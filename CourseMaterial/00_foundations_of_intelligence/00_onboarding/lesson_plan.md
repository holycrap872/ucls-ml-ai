## Essential Questions

- What are the topics covered by the course?
- What are the expectations of the class?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students are introduced to the content and expectations of the
course. Right before the end, projects from the previous year are shown to
provide some grounding of what's possible. Finally, there's a questionnaire so
that I can understand the skill levels of the class.
 
> Note: The class has to fill 40m (and previously ended ~35m) so I added a
  few "mini discussion" questions to fill the time.
