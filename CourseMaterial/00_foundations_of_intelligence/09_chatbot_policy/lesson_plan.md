## Lesson Plan

This lesson sets the tone for ChatBot usage within the class. It also exposes
students to the long term theme of "what is learning?" As such, the class will
discuss how ChatBots should be used within different disciplines and how it
should be approached as you're trying to learn. After all of this, students will
start to work on the first of the long-running problems sets.
