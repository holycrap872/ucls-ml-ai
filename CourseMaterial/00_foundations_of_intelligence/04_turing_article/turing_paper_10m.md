### Computing Machinery and Intelligence

By: Alan Turing (1950)

#### 1. The Imitation Game

I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with
definitions of the meaning of the terms "machine" and "think." The definitions might be
framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is
dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by
examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the
meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a
statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a
definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is
expressed in relatively unambiguous words.

The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the
"imitation game." [It is played with three participants, a human interrogator, an human
answerer, and a machine answerer. The interrogator stays in a room apart from the other
two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two
is the person and which is the machine....]

#### 6. Contrary Views on the Main Question

It will simplify matters for the reader if I explain first my own beliefs in the matter.
Consider first the more accurate form of the question. I believe that in about fifty years
time it will be possible, to programme computers, with a storage capacity of about 10^9, to
make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have
more than 70 per cent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of
questioning. The original question, "Can machines think?" I believe to be too
meaningless to deserve discussion. Nevertheless I believe that at the end of the century
the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be
able to speak of machines thinking without expecting to be contradicted...

#### 7. Learning Machines

In the process of trying to imitate an adult human mind we are bound to think a good deal
about the process which has brought it to the state that it is in. We may notice three
components.

1. The initial state of the mind, say at birth,
2. The education to which it has been subjected,
3. Other experience, not to be described as education, to which it has been subjected.

Instead of trying to produce a programme to simulate the adult mind, why not rather try
to produce one which simulates the child's? If this were then subjected to an appropriate
course of education one would obtain the adult brain. Presumably the child brain is
something like a notebook as one buys it from the stationer's. Rather little mechanism,
and lots of blank sheets. (Mechanism and writing are from our point of view almost
synonymous.) Our hope is that there is so little mechanism in the child brain that
something like it can be easily programmed. The amount of work in the education we can
assume, as a first approximation, to be much the same as for the human child.
We have thus divided our problem into two parts. The child programme and the
education process...

The idea of a learning machine may appear paradoxical to some readers. How can the
rules of operation of the machine change? They should describe completely how the
machine will react whatever its history might be, whatever changes it might undergo. The
rules are thus quite time-invariant. This is quite true. The explanation of the paradox is
that the rules which get changed in the learning process are of a rather less pretentious
kind, claiming only an ephemeral validity. The reader may draw a parallel with the
Constitution of the United States.

An important feature of a learning machine is that its teacher will often be very largely
ignorant of quite what is going on inside, although he may still be able to some extent to
predict his pupil's behavior. This should apply most strongly to the later education of a
machine arising from a child machine of well-tried design (or programme). This is in
clear contrast with normal procedure when using a machine to do computations one's
object is then to have a clear mental picture of the state of the machine at each moment in
the computation. This object can only be achieved with a struggle. The view that "the
machine can only do what we know how to order it to do," appears strange in face of
this. Most of the programmes which we can put into the machine will result in its doing
something that we cannot make sense (if at all, or which we regard as completely random
behaviour. Intelligent behaviour presumably consists in a departure from the completely
disciplined behaviour involved in computation, but a rather slight one, which does not
give rise to random behaviour, or to pointless repetitive loops. Another important result
of preparing our machine for its part in the imitation game by a process of teaching and
learning is that "human fallibility" is likely to be omitted in a rather natural way, i.e.,
without special "coaching." ... Processes that are learnt do not produce a hundred percent
certainty of result; if they did they could not be unlearnt...

Now the learning process may be regarded as a search for a form of
behaviour which will satisfy the teacher (or some other criterion). Since there is probably
a very large number of satisfactory solutions the random method seems to be better than
the systematic. It should be noticed that it is used in the analogous process of evolution.
But there the systematic method is not possible. How could one keep track of the
different genetical combinations that had been tried, so as to avoid trying them again?
We may hope that machines will eventually compete with men in all purely intellectual
fields. But which are the best ones to start with? Even this is a difficult decision. Many
people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can
also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that
money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could
follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc.
Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried.

We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.
