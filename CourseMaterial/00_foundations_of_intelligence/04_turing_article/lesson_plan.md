## Essential Questions

- Where does consciousness lie?
- How does search space exploration relate to intelligence?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students discuss the Turing paper and relate it to the previous
lessons on "search space exploration" and "intelligence". Students should come
in prepared to discuss the article and the EQ's provided the night before. Prior
to the discussion starting, students will be given a few minutes to journal and
prepare for the discussion. Then the discussion will happen with the teacher
grading the overall flow. Finally, there will be a debrief (since it's the first
discussion of the year) and reflection.
