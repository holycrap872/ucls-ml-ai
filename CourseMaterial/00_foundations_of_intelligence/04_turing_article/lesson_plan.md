### Actual Lesson

Only do this if they're really interested in the philosophy of the mind stuff

> Note: I haven't actually done this.

Have them read "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" by Alan Turning and be
prepared to discuss. It's a long article, so instead of reading everything I'd
suggest:

- Section 6, 6.1, and 6.2
- Section 7 starting with the paragraph that starts with "In the process of
  trying to imitate an adult human mind".


- Take quick reading quiz
    - TBD
- Get ready for discussion



- Discuss eventual chatbot policy (if have time)
    - Won't be allowed to use any until second term
    - At that point, anything goes
    - Likely going to ask you folks to be involved in some way to get student's view
