## Essential Questions

- How does CI/CD work under the hood?
- How much can rationality tell us about our experience?

## Lesson Plan

Basically this lesson is a bit of a stretch lesson to allow the students more
time to kick of their Python "rust". First, we do multiple reviews on TIL/Code
to let students see expectations. Then we do a brief walk-through of the VMs
behind CI/CD and link it to rationalism. Finally, students have the opportunity
to work on their homework.

### Setup

- CI/CD website open so can examine what's going on
    - https://gitlab.ucls.uchicago.edu/erizzi/pss-example
