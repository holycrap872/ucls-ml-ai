## Essential Questions

- How does human generated code compare with AI generated code?
- How can we use AI to improve our own coding abilities?


## Lesson Plan

This lesson is the final lesson in the SDE-Bootcamp unit. Students first reflect
on what they have learned (git, terminal, CI/CD). Then, they do the last few
problems of the `Python String Wheaties` problem set and compare their solutions
with solutions generated by an AI.

### Setup

- Feedback done for everyone on wheaties done so far
- `Human vs. AI Comparison` worksheet pushed to Schoology
    - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQCPRWvj5NFtIXzdm8vN-o78t5ZvF_vRA85PAyezRaI

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - CI/CD
- Unit Review
    - CI/CD
    - `git`
    - Command-Line
    - Why did we learn these tools so early in the term?
- Feedback time
    - Explain how I give feedback
        - https://conventionalcomments.org/
    - I gave out feedback to everyone
    - 7m to read (and if you have time, integrate chances)
- Code Review
    - Spin the wheel
    - Show how the jobs for the CI/CD look/work
    - Walk through both code and tests
- Start classwork
    - Whole point is to reflect about how to use AI to improve
    - Do problems yourself first
    - Later, ask AI and compare the results
    - Questions?
- Go!

### Homework

- Finish `Human vs. AI Comparison` worksheet
