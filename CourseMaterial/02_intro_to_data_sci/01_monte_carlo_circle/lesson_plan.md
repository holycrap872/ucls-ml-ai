## Essential Questions

- How can we use randomness to solve hard problems?
- How does the quantity and quality of data affect ML outcomes?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, students are introduced to randomness. This lesson really kicks
off the "data science" unit in earnest. Students will see how good data can
lead to interesting/useful conclusions. Care will be taken to: 
1. Separate data generation from analysis
2. Prepare students for working with pre-generated data
3. Appreciate how large quantities of data improve outcomes
4. Appreciate how the speed/power of computers opens up new avenues for analysis

### Setup

- Paper and pencil so can simulate Monte Carlo method
- Wikipedia page loaded so can see Monte Carlo simulation
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method
- Monte Carlo Worksheet loaded up in Schoology
    - Structured: https://docs.google.com/document/d/11h5Xa6s6rMgayko8BXp4bPpxtYDhpC_-As9ktSmdI5g
    - Unstructured: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EEVFhbRojiaaFZse698KwxMyrZROzux8XKCbSIbfNRE

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Libraries
    - Installing libraries
    - Show documentation for libraries
- Today going to learn about the Monte Carlo method
- Anyone heard of Monte Carlo analysis?
    - Bunch of random points
    - Demonstrate by drawing a duck on a piece of paper and dropping pencil
    - Can be used to find very good approximation of very difficult shapes
        - Find percentage that particular shape takes up of space
        - If know area of space, then can also find area of shape
- For example:
    - Find area under x^2 curve
    - How would we do this?
        - Plan out/discuss together
    - Show code and run
    - That's calculus!
- Have students draw a figure and estimate value
    - What variables are you keeping track of
    - What is the final calculation you're doing?
- Today going to calculate the area of a circle using the Monte Carlo method
    - How would we do this?
        - Plan out/discuss together
- Get started!

### Homework

- None
