## EQ's

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to pick up where we left off and get students doing
a full day of programming. As I go around, I will suggest various things (e.g.,
types and tests) that will help each of them as they encounter a problem.

### Setup

- None

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - What did we do last class?
    - Why is being in a workspace important?
    - How do you know that you are/are not in a workspace?
- Run through someone's example
- Talk about worksheet
    - Explain progression of problems:
        - Shows use of `input`
        - Ability to run a program
        - Ability to create/use a function
        - Conditionals
        - type conversion
        - Algorithms
        - Loops
        - Various accesses in a list
        - Multiple lists
        - List creation
        - Unit testing
        - Sorting
        - Assertions
- Today going to just program as much as we can
    - If you work hard today, no homework
- Continue working on skills assessment

## Homework

- None
