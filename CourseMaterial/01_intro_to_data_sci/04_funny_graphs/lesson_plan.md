## Essential Questions

- How can we best use outside tools to augment our learning?
- How do we represent data in an effective way?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson exposes students to `matplotlib` and gets them started writing
their own code. It's a good lesson because students create their own "funny
graphs" which can ameliorate some of the skill differences. By the end, students
will have discussed how to interpret a cheat sheet, how to install a library,
and why data interpretation is pivotal to ML/AI.

### Setup

- `graph_cheatsheet.md` loaded into Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - What did we do last time?
        - What was hard about skills assessment?
        - What were things suddenly remembered?
    - Discuss proposed Chatbot policy
- Today, going to work on graphing
    - Bar Charts:

- What are libraries?
    - Code someone else has written?
    - Super important to CS
- Hand out cheat sheet
- Show my code and discuss a bit
    - See `funny_graphs.py`
        - `matplotlib` library
        - How to use pip install
        - Amount of "funniness" may vary
- How to interpret cheat sheet?
- Have them recreate "Supernatural Powers" graph
- Show common mistakes
    - x/y arrays of different size
    - misspelled colors
    - Bad labels...

### Homework

- Create two different types of "joke graphs"
    - Will show them at the beginning of next class
