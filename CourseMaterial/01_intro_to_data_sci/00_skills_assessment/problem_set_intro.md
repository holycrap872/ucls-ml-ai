# Python Intro Wheaties

Create two new files in your problem set skeleton. Name one file
`intro_wheaties.py` and put it in the `src` folder (`src/intro_wheaties.py`).
Name the other file `test_intro_wheaties.py` and put it in the `test` folder
(`test/test_intro_wheaties.py`).

For each problem, create a new function in the `intro_wheaties.py` file and
then write at **least** three unit tests is the `test_intro_wheaties.py` file.

# Problems

### Problems using **parameters** for input and `return` for output

0. Create a function that takes three numbers as input and returns the smallest
   number. Do **not** use any outside helper functions (e.g., `min()`).
1. Create a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum
   of all the numbers in the list. Do **not** use any outside helper functions
   (e.g., `sum()`). Create at least three unit tests.
2. Create a function that takes two lists of numbers of the same size as input
   and returns a single list with each of the numbers in the same indices added
   together. For example `[1, 4], [3, 2] -> [4, 6]` Create at least three unit
   test.
3. Create a function that takes a list of pairs and returns a single list with
   each of the pairs added together. For example `[(1, 4), (3, 10)] -> [5, 13]`.
   Create at least three unit tests.
