## Essential Questions

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

This is the first attempt at being technical in the class. The goal is to
figure out where the students are along several dimensions.

1. How well do they setup a project's environment?
2. How much do they remember about programming?
3. What other things do I not know about?

### Setup

- `ProblemSetSkeleton` ready to go
    - Git compatible
- Skills assessment worksheet on Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Who was Turing?
    - What was his test?
    - What did we learn?
    - What is machine learning?
        - Program, data, and feedback
- Setup skills assessment
    - Today going to see how far you can get programming stuff
    - No pressure at all
- What do we remember about python?
    - list
    - variables
    - primitives
- IDE
    - Brief history of IDE
    - Show VIM

- Purpose of IDE
- Walk through vscode setup
    - Install necessary extensions and get running
        - Python Extension
        - Pylance
        - Vim!
    - Do simple program together
        - Get everyone running a simple "hello world" program
        - Take in numbers from user until they hit "q" and then sums then
- Download and setup `ProblemSetSkeleton`
    - Importance of being in workspace
        - Get bunch of advanced features
        - Note to instructor: Check that people have proper setup repeatedly over coming days
- Get started on `skills_assessment`
    - Walk around prodding people to improve practices in various ways
