## Essential Questions

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

This is the first attempt at being technical in the class. The goal is to
figure out where the students are along several dimensions:

1. How well do they setup a project's environment?
2. How much do they remember about programming?
3. What other things do I not know about?

### Setup

- `ProblemSetSkeleton` ready to go
    - https://gitlab.com/eric.rizzi/problem-set-skeleton
- Skills assessment worksheet posted on Schoology

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Who was Turing?
    - What was his test?
    - What did we learn?
    - What is machine learning?
        - Program, data, and feedback
- Setup skills assessment
    - Today going to see how far you can get programming stuff
    - No pressure at all
- What do we remember about Python?
    - list
    - variables
    - primitives
- IDE
    - Brief history of IDE
    - Modern day IDE's are like a bento box
    - All parts of development in one place
        - Used to have to use multiple different programs
- Walk through vscode setup
    - Who was able to install everything?
    - Install necessary extensions and get running
        - Python Extension
        - Black Formatter
        - Isort
        - Pylance
        - Vim!
    - Do simple programs as a class
        - Get everyone running a simple "hello world" program
        - Take in numbers from user until they hit "q" and then sums then
    - Highlight what extensions are doing
- Download and setup `ProblemSetSkeleton`
    - Importance of being in workspace
        - Get bunch of advanced features
        - Note to instructor: Check that people have proper setup repeatedly over coming days
- Get started on `skills_assessment.pdf`
    - Walk around prodding people to improve practices in various ways

## Homework
