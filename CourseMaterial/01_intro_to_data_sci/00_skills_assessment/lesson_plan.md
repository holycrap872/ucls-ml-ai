## Essential Questions

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

This is the first attempt at being technical in the class. The goal is to
figure out where the students are along several dimensions.

1. How well do they setup a project's environment?
2. How much do they remember about programming?
3. What other things do I not know about?

> This class will be split into multiple lessons. The first class just tries to
  get everyone up and running with vscode installed. The second class starts to
  add in best practices such as types and unit tests.
