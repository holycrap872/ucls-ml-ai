## EQ's

- What do we want to remember?
- What do we actually remember?

## Lesson Plan

This is the first attempt at being technical in the class. The goal is to
figure out where the students are along several dimensions.

1. How well do they setup a project's environment?
2. How much do they remember about programming?
3. What other things do I not know about?

> This class will be split into multiple lessons. The first class just tries to
  get everyone up and running with vscode installed. The second class starts to
  add in best practices such as types and unit tests.

### Setup

- None (worksheet should be on schoology)

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Who was Turing?
    - What was his test?
    - What did we learn?
    - What is machine learning?
        - Program, data, and feedback
- Setup skills assessment
    - Today going to see how far you can get programming stuff
    - No pressure at all
- What do we remember about python?
    - list
    - variables
    - primitives
- Walk through vscode setup
    - Install necessary extensions and get running
    - Do simple program together
        - Take in numbers from user until they hit "q" and then sums then
- Walk around prodding people to improve practices in various ways
    - types!!!

## Homework

- Finish the problem you are working on using **any resource** you would like
    - One caveat is you must be able to explain it tomorrow to me
    - I'll be going around individually
