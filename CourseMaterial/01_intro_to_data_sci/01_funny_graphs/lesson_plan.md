## Essential Questions

- How can we best use outside tools to augment our learning?
- How do we represent data in an effective way?

## Lesson Plan

This lesson exposes students to `matplotlib` and gets them started writing
their own code. It's a good lesson because students create their own "funny
graphs" which can ameliorate some of the skill differences. By the end, students
will have discussed how to interpret a cheat sheet, how to install a library,
and why data interpretation is pivotal to ML/AI.

### Setup

- `graph_cheatsheet.md` loaded into Schoology
- Funny Graphs Worksheet loaded into Schoology
