## Essential Questions

- Why are tests important?
- What is the best kind of test?

## Lesson Plan

The goal of this lesson is to pick up where we left off and get students doing
a full day of programming. First, we will do a code review with a volunteers
code. After this, I will explain how future code reviews will go. Finally,
students will pick back up with the skills assessment. While they're working, I
wil go around and suggest various things (e.g., types and tests) that will help
each of them as they encounter a problem.

### Setup

- None

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Why is being in a workspace important?
    - What should you do when you can't run tests?
- Code review
    - Ask for volunteer
    - Palindrome problem
        - Very common "break loop" structures
    - Max problem from earlier
        - Making stuff functions makes them easier to test
    - Discuss why they are good
    - "I would rather lose all my code than all my tests"
- Talk about "code review" expectations:
    - Rather than volunteer, wheel to see who get's picked on

    - If someone spots a bug in your code (hacker) they steal 5 points
        - Hacking is someone understanding you code better than you
