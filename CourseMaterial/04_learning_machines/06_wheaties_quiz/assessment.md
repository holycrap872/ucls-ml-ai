# Python Wheaties Quiz

Create two new files in your `ProblemSetSkeleton` workspace. Name one file
`quiz_1_wheaties.py` and put it in the `src/skeleton` folder
(`src/skeleton/quiz_1_wheaties.py`). Name the other file `test_quiz_1_wheaties.py`
and put it in the `test` folder (`test/test_quiz_1_wheaties.py`).

For each problem, create a new function in the `quiz_1_wheaties.py` file and
then write at **least two unit tests** in the `test_quiz_1_wheaties.py` file.

## Grading:

- 10% for using proper types
- 60% for correct functionality
- 30% for tests that "stress" different paths through the functions

# Problems

0. Create a function that takes a list of integers **and** a list of strings as
   inputs and then returns a single list that is the string at each index
   repeated the number of times of the number at that index.
    - Assume that the two lists are of the same length.
    - For example: `[5, 2, 1], ["b", "bye", "hi"] -> ["bbbbb", "byebye", "hi"]`
    - Hint: `3 * "hi" -> "hihihi"`
0. Create a function that takes a list of strings as input and returns a
   dictionary where the keys are single letters and the values are sets of
   strings with that first letter.
    - For example: `["apple", "bad", "am"] -> {"a": {"apple", "am"}, "b": {"bad"}}`
    - Hint: To create an empty accumulator dict, you do `acc_dict = dict()`
0. Create a tool for calculating which internal combustion cars can travel a
   particular distance on a single tank of gas. Cars should be NamedTuples that
   include `model` (str), `tank_size` (float), and `mpg` (float). Create a
   function that takes a list of cars and a desired travel distance and returns
   a set of strings of all of the models that can go the given distance.
