## Essential Questions
- What are the core features of an evolutionary process?
- How is life similar to a search space algorithm?
- What other systems exhibit evolutionary characteristics?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection:
    - What did we talk about last time?
- Today, going to shift gears to evolutionary algorithms
- What is evolution?
    - Variation
    - Differential fitness
    - Heretiabilty
    - Turn the crank
- Visualization:

- Going to play game "Evolution"
    - Mostly just want to have fun
    - Pay attention to where it mimics actual evolutionary processes
- Play!
- Discussion
    - Where is the game similar to real life?
        - Differential fitness!
            - Better adapted you are to the environ, more likey to survive
        - Heritaility of fitness
            - Kind of...
    - Where does it differ?
        - Variation
            - Would have to be able to "split" species to get this to work
    - Tree of Life
        - At least for animals
