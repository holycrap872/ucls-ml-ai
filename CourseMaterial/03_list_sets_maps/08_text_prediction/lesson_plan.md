## Essential Questions

- How do we create a Markov model?
- How can we use a Markov model to drive text generation?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

Sufficient copies of `predict_text.md` printed out

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Review graph
    - Review Markov model homework
    - Go through someone's example
- How to derive random strings from this?
    - Do as class together
    - Do a few examples and discuss
- Deficiencies
    - Wasn't recording probability
    - How to include probability
    - Alter code to capture it together
    - Stress types
- ChatBot
    - Words instead of letters
    - Back to "I like turtles" example
- Worksheet
    - Read through worksheet
    - Before starting, come up with possible functions

Extensions:
- Formally define the behvaior in terms of probability
    - Bayes
