## Essential Questions

- Why are maps, sets, and lists such powerful datastructures?
- What situations lend themselves to the use of these datastructures?

## Lesson Plan

- Refresher
    - What does "the perfect setup" look like
        - shell, vscode, and ChatGPT open
    - Show someone's homework on git
    - Discuss both the homework and git
- New unit!
    - Data Structures: maps (dicts), sets, and lists
- What do you remember about these?
    - It's in Grok
- Philosophy:
    - Only need these three data structures
    - Lists are ordered
    - Sets are existence
    - Dictionaries are relationships

    - People waiting outside "da club" -> list
    - People inside "da club" -> set
    - Search engine -> dict
- Do one example of each in Python
- Hand out worksheet and let do it for 10 minutes in pairs
    - Discuss when come back

## Homework

- TIL entry about syntax/purpose of each data structure
