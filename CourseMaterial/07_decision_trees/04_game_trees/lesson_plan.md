## Essential Questions

- Why are trees an effective way or organizing data?
- How can we represent decisions in a game via a tree?

## Lesson Plan

### Actual Lesson

- Review

- Starting a unit on trees. Where have we seen trees so far?
    - Linux file system
    - Git
    - Weka decision tree
    - Dictionaries of dictionaries
    - Graphs (kind of)
- What are properties of trees?
    - Nodes, edges, single root, leaves
    - Fast!
    - How different from graph?
- Play single coin NIM
    - Pile of 9 coins
    - Each player can take either one or two coins
    - Misere game
- Debrief
    - Would you rather go first or second?
    - What's the trick?
        - Want to go FIRST if heap is multiple of 3, SECOND otherwise
- Draw the game tree
    - Properties of game trees
        - Turn based
        - Guaranteed win if every path leads to a win
    - Tree traversal
        - DFS
        - BFS
- Play "odds and evens hand game"
    - Analyze assuming opponent goes first
- Guess size of various game trees
    - 2 pile nim
    - Wordle "analysis" bot
    - Chess
    - Checkers
    - go

### Homework

- Play a game against the "optimal tic tac toe game" as seen in XKCD. Draw your
  path through the tree and write a paragraph explaining what was going on.
