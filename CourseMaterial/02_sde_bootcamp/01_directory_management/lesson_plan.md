## Essential Questions

- How can we use the command-line to increase our effectiveness?
- How much effort should I put into understanding the tools I'm using?

## Lesson Plan

In this class, students formalize the knowledge they gained while playing
`GameShell` the previous day. After the review/discussion students will start
a command-line worksheet that will make the concepts more grounded.
