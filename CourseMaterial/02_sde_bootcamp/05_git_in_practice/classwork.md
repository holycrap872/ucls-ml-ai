# Git In Practice Classwork

## TIL Entry:

Most git repositories have a `.gitignore` file. This is particularly important
in Python projects because of the number of "computer generated files" that
shouldn't be committed. Research and write a short TIL post about `.gitignore`
files. The post _must_ include the following:

- A Title
- 2-3 sentences demonstrating you understand the concept
- The use of \` or \`\`\` to make a command stand out from text

In addition, the entry itself must be in a file that matches the following
folder structure:

```
- Today I Learn Repository
    - README.md
    - Git
        - NEW_GIT_IGNORE_ENTRY.md (you can choose your own file name)
```

Once you have done this, commit the changes and push it to your repository.

## Python List Wheaties:

Complete the `Python List Wheaties` sheet. Each time you complete a problem and
its tests, commit the changes and push it to your `ProblemSetSkeleton` repo.
