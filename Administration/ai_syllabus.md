back and ask ourselves, what are the possible downsides"* - Emily Bender

# Artificial Intelligence

This half-year course allows students to build on the knowledge they gained in
the previous semester and to utilize these new skills to build a project of
their choosing. In particular, students will continue to be exposed to a
variety of AI/ML techniques including decision trees and neural networks.
Students will implement part or all of these techniques in python and then use
the resulting functionality to draw conclusions about various datasets.
Alongside each of these engineering tasks, students will also be exposed to
readings that highlight the trade offs that come from asking machines to make
important decisions and the difficulty of determining the root of consciousness.

The goal of this course is for students to emerge as capable engineers and as
critical creators of technology. In terms of engineering, students will become
schooled in best practices such as CI/CD, virtual machines, and git. In terms
critical thinking, students will be forced to explain how different
philosophical ideas map onto different technical ideas and how they might be
utilized in the future. Students will continually come back to questioning how
to accomplish a particular task, what the costs and benefits of their decisions
are, and what the hidden downstream effects of their decisions might be.

## Essential Questions

- How do we create an automated system that is usable, understandable, and safe?
- What are the essential properties of cognition and how do they relate to AI
  systems?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques underlying the AI
  systems we interact with on a daily basis?
- How can we create systems that avoid our personal biases and the limits of
  our knowledge?
- How can we utilize outside resources to increase our own capabilities?
- How can data be used to produce just outcomes?

## Learning Objectives

- To learn common programming and engineering techniques.
- To utilize AI to extract knowledge from data.
- To articulate the value of data in isolation and in aggregate.
- To understand how the notion of consciousness has evolved over time.
- To identify areas where AI has been given the power to make real-world decisions.
- To assess the decisions made by existing AI systems and detect unjust outcomes.
- To develop confidence and a problem-solving mindset when dealing with new
  techniques.
- To engage with the material carefully and thoughtfully; to search for and
  analyze complex meaning.
- To lead and participate in class discussions and group activities with
  respect, interest, and enthusiasm.
- To use specific examples from texts and lessons as evidence for a particular
  view.

## Required Texts and Materials

No texts are required. All instructional materials will be posted on Schoology.

Students will need access to a personal computer at home on which they can
install programs and do their homework. Any desktop or laptop computer (i.e.,
not a phone or a tablet) will suffice as long as it's **not a Chromebook**.
Windows, Mac, or Linux machines are all acceptable.

## Expectations

Generally, I expect you to be invested in the class and to be an active and
positive member of our classroom community. In addition, I expect you to take
your development seriously as a reader, writer, and programmer. The following
are some specific guidelines that will help you to meet these expectations:

- Come to class prepared. This means you should have completed all of the
  assignments due for that day’s class, and you should have annotated the text
  of any assigned reading.
- Remain open-minded and sensitive during class discussions.
- Laptops, Cell Phones, Ipads, and other electronic devices are useful tools but
  also wonderful distractions. Your laptop should be charged for class, but
  it should only be open when instructed. **Place your cell phones in your
  backpack. If you need to use it during class, quietly go into the hallway.**
- I expect each of you to make a solid, good-faith effort to do your best in
  this class (and I expect the same from myself). I know, however, that this
  class is just one of the many aspects of your life, so please talk to me if you
  need help doing your best work.
- If you have questions or concerns, please ask me anytime. Also, please ask
  if you don't know why we’re doing something or if you have a better idea.

In addition to the above expectations, you should complete all assignments and
readings to the best of your abilities, setting and achieving high standards for
your work. This desired work ethic includes demonstrating a willingness to seek
guidance, to take suggestions with open-mindedness, and to act on the feedback
received in revising assignments and preparing future work.

## Coursework

Assignments for this course can be broken up into different types which will
typically involve:

- Classwork (during class): This will involve programming challenges which
  you will complete individually or with partners to practice the concepts
  that are presented. Usually, you will be able to finish the regular
  (non-extension) parts of these assignments during class. Regular parts that
  aren't completed during class time will usually need to be finished outside of
  class time before the next class period. **Late classwork will not receive
  credit.** You are encouraged to follow up on non-functioning code with me
  outside of class time.
- Homework (after class): Standard assignments (done individually) to practice
  and develop mastery of the material covered in class.
- Quizzes: Straightforward programming and multiple-choice questions to ensure
  your understanding of the terminology and the application of the concepts of
  the course.
- Projects: Sometimes classwork and homework will be part of a continuing
  group project. In this case, you will have to schedule time outside of class
  to work with your partner. This could be done using Zoom or Google Meet.

Late or revised homework, projects and quizzes will be accepted with a
letter-grade penalty up until the end of a unit. Once we move on to the next
unit, no late or revised work from the prior units will be accepted. In practice,
though, you will want to complete any missing assignments as soon as possible as
future work will build on previously covered concepts.

## Grading and Assessment

Units will be weighted according to the amount of time that we spend on them,
and unit grades will be broken down into the following categories:

- Classwork: 20%
- Homework: 20%
- Discussions: 10%
- Quizzes: 10%
- Projects: 40%

Grades for assignments will be posted on Schoology within one week of their due
date.

## Time Expectations

You should expect two to three hours of homework per week. This breaks down to
about thirty minutes of homework after each class period.

With programming, it is very easy to get stuck. You are advised to start early
on assignments so that if you do get stuck, you will be able to take advantage
of the many times that I am available for appointments.

## Academic Integrity Policy

You are encouraged to work together with your fellow classmates during class
time on activities, but homework assignments (unless otherwise noted) are meant
to be done individually. This is because these assignments are meant to assess
whether you have grasped the material and can complete the problems without
outside help.

You are required to turn in your own work. Copying/pasting from **any** source
without citation is not acceptable. Looking at someone else's code and retyping
it is not acceptable. Discussing an assignment with other students and helping
other students troubleshoot broken code is acceptable, but you should never
dictate your code to another student but should, rather, guide them along a path
of inquiry.

The spirit of this policy is to make sure that you are the owner of the work
you are producing. If you are unable to explain a solution you produce, you
will receive a zero for the assignment and the Dean of Students will be
notified.

## Accommodations Statement

All of us learn in different ways and the organization of any course may need
to accommodate each student differently. For example, you may prefer to process
information by speaking and listening, so that some of the written material for
this course may be difficult to absorb. Please talk to me as soon as you can
about your individual learning needs and how this course can best accommodate
them. If you require accommodations to participate fully in this course, please
let me know as soon as possible.

## Email Policy

Generally, I do not check email between 7pm and 7am (the next school day).
Students who email me during these hours should not expect a response until
after 7am.

## Absence Policy

If you miss a class, you should review the materials on Schoology and follow up
with me if there’s anything there that you don't understand.
