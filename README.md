# Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

This repository attempts to capture a full year high school class that teaches
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. The students within the course
range from 10th graders who have completed a 9th grade "Intro to CS" course to
students who have completed AP CS in java.

## Mission

The purpose of the course is to simultaneously teach students the equivalent
of an "advanced python" course and introduce them to various state of the art
techniques in AI/ML.

## Navigation

To understand the course, there are four places to look:

- The [Course Syllabus](./CourseDocuments/ai_syllabus.md) document for 
  the general expectations of the course handed out at the beginning of the year.
- The [AI Course Overview](./CourseDocuments/ai_course_overview.md)
  document for and understanding of the units of covered in the first semester.
- The [ML Course Overview](./CourseDocuments/ml_course_overview.md)
  document for and understanding of the units of covered in the second semester.
- The [Course Material](./CourseMaterial/) folder for the full set of lesson plans
  and activities.

## Contributions

Overall, this course is a work in progress and I am open to any/all suggestions.

# Thoughts (Do not commit)

1. Do evolutionary algorithms instead of decision trees because can do games
    - Games scale better as projects
2. Do "summative quizzes" of everything learned at the end of every week
    - 5-6 multiple choice questions, can take as many times as want
